- 👋 Hi, I’m @amandahaynie
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, new challenges, process improvement, and anything that involves creativity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on what makes the best customer service companies so great at what they do, building out quality monitoring in a call center, and how to use XM Discover to monitor conditional process steps to eliminate the need to manually review interactions.
- 📫 Reach reach me at amandahaynie@hotmail.com or alhmcb@gmail.com.
